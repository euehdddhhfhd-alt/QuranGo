    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi — this page explains, in plain language, what we collect about you, why we collect it, and how you can make choices about your data.</p>
  </section>
<section>
    <h2>What we collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only what we need to run the site:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Automatic info:</strong> basic technical details like which pages you visit, your browser, and your IP address — usually used in aggregate to help improve the site.</li>
      <li><strong>Ad data:</strong> ad partners (such as Google AdSense) may use cookies or identifiers to deliver and measure ads.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

<section>
    <h2>Ads & cookies</h2>
    <p>We use Google AdSense to show ads. Ad partners may set cookies or use other identifiers to deliver and measure ads.</p>
    <p>If you prefer not to see personalized ads, visit <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Ad Settings</a>. You can also manage cookies in your browser, though that may affect how the site works for you.</p>
    <p>We also include a small debug helper (runs in your browser only) that checks whether ad slots are filled and logs status in the developer console; it does not collect or send personal data.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Third parties</h2>
    <p>We use Google AdSense to display ads. At the moment we do not include separate analytics libraries like Google Analytics — only ad partners may collect ad-related data.</p>
  </section>

<section>
    <h2>How we use your information</h2>
    <p>In short: to run the site and to make it better. Specifically, we use information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fix bugs and improve site content and speed.</li>
      <li>Show ads so we can fund hosting and development.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may share data with service providers who help us host the site, analyze traffic, or deliver ads. These providers have their own privacy policies.</p>
  </section>

<section>
    <h2>Your choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Opt out of personalized ads:</strong> Visit <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Ad Settings</a> to opt out of personalized advertising.</li>
      <li><strong>Block cookies:</strong> You can block or delete cookies in your browser settings (some site features may not work properly if you do this).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

<section>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We work to keep your information safe by using standard technical measures. While we do our best, no system is 100% secure — if you think your data has been exposed, please let us know right away.</p>
  </section>

<section>
    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>This site is not aimed at children under 13. If you believe we have collected a child’s information, tell us and we will delete it.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>If we make important changes, we’ll update the date at the top and post the new version here. We encourage you to check this page from time to time.</p>
